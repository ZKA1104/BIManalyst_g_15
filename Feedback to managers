Feedback to Managers: 
The combination of the tool and tutorial offers a comprehensive and efficient approach to analyzing acoustic performance in office spaces,
streamlining the process and significantly reducing the time and effort required. By addressing key challenges in acoustic design,
this solution equips architects and engineers with practical insights, enhancing their ability to create environments that meet desired acoustic standards.
The step-by-step guide stands out for its clarity and thoroughness, catering to users with varying levels of expertise. Whether you’re new to acoustic analysis 
or an experienced professional, the tutorial’s well-structured instructions ensure an intuitive learning experience. Its seamless integration with IFC models further 
enhances its value, enabling users to directly incorporate architectural data into their analyses without the need for additional conversions or modifications.

Enhancements to Consider:
To maximize the tool’s usability and impact, consider incorporating visual aids, such as screenshots, diagrams, or flowcharts, to provide a clearer understanding of
the processes involved. These elements could make the tutorial even more accessible, particularly for visual learners.
Additionally, including a feature that compares the tool’s output with recognized acoustic standards would allow users to quickly assess compliance and identify areas
needing improvement. A dedicated troubleshooting section could address common issues or errors, helping users overcome obstacles without delay.
For added functionality, customizable options such as filtering rooms by parameters like volume, surface area, or material type could allow for more tailored analyses, 
aligning with specific project requirements. These enhancements would not only improve user experience but also broaden the tool’s appeal as a reliable resource in acoustic performance optimization.
