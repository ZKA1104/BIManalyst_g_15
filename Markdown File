##About the Tool

###Problem/Claim  
The tool addresses the challenge of calculating the U-Value of windows and glazing materials,
which plays a crucial role in optimizing thermal insulation, daylight penetration, and energy efficiency in buildings.

### Source of the Problem  
This problem is detailed in the report titled *"CES_BLD_24_0_6_MEP"* (page 15),
highlighting the importance of balancing thermal performance with daylight entry
to achieve sustainable and energy-efficient design.

### Description of the Tool  
The tool is a Python-based OpenBIM ifcOpenShell solution designed to calculate U-Values
for windows and glazing systems. It simulates the impact of these properties on daylight
performance and energy efficiency, providing an open-source alternative for analysis in BIM environments. 
By allowing interoperability, it promotes cost savings, process automation, and sustainability in design.

### Instructions to Run the Tool  
1. Input Data: 
   - Import an IFC model containing window or glazing data and material properties into the Python environment.

2. Run Script:
   - Execute the Python script to calculate the U-Value and simulate daylight performance.

3. Analyze Results:
   - Compare results against energy efficiency standards and design objectives.

4. Output:
   - Generate visualizations (e.g., graphs) and reports summarizing findings for decision-making.

Advanced Building Design

### Advanced Building Design Stage  
The tool is most beneficial in **Stage B: Simulation and Analysis,
where the performance of design choices is evaluated for energy efficiency and daylight optimization.

### Subjects That Might Use the Tool  
- Architectural Design: For aesthetic and functional decisions related to building envelopes.  
- Building Physics: To assess thermal performance and energy efficiency.  
- Energy Efficiency Analysis: To optimize material selection and comply with energy standards.  
- Lighting Design: To ensure sufficient daylight penetration while minimizing energy loss.

### Required Information for the Tool  
To calculate the U-Value and simulate daylight performance, the tool requires the following data:  
- Thermal conductivity of materials (glass, frame, and gas).  
- Type and number of glazing layers (e.g., double or triple glazing).  
- Thickness of the glass and gaps between panes.  
- Gas properties used in cavities (e.g., air, argon).  
- Low-E coatings and spacer bar materials.  
- Window or glazing system dimensions and geometry.  
- Solar Heat Gain Coefficient or Visible Light Transmittance for daylight analysis.
